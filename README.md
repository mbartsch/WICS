Watering and Irrigation Control System

This is a project to integrate various devices to create a 
Control System for an irrigation system

Low Level Control:

 * USB Nano V3.0 ATmega328 16M 5V Micro-controller CH340G board For Arduino
 * Ultrasonic Sensor Module HC-SR04 Distance Measuring Sensor for arduino SR04
 * 4 Channel Relay Module With optocoupler For PIC AVR DSP ARM Arduino 8051
 * IIC I2C Logic Level Converter Bi-Directional Module 5V to 3.3V For Arduino
 * Soil Hygrometer Detection Module Soil Moisture Sensor For arduino Smart car
 * Raindrops Detection sensor modue rain module weather module Humidity For Arduino

High Level Control:
 * Raspberry Pi Model B

For the high level control, all is written in Arduino Sketch, High Level will be python/php maybe. Communication between RPi and Arduino will be over I2C (serial could be a lot easy, but I want to learn a little with this project)
